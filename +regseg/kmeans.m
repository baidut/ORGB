%% Color-Based Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
% This example shows how to segment colors in an automated fashion using the
% L*a*b* color space and K-means clustering.
%
% This example requires Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox(TM).

%% Step 1: Read Image
% Read in |hestain.png|, which is an image of tissue stained with hemotoxylin
% and eosin (H&E). This staining method helps pathologists distinguish different
% tissue types.

% I = imread('hestain.png');
% imshow(I), title('H&E image');
% text(size(I,2),size(I,1)+15,...
%      'Image courtesy of Alan Partin, Johns Hopkins University', ...
%      'FontSize',7,'HorizontalAlignment','right');


%% Step 2: Convert Image from RGB Color Space to L*a*b* Color Space
% How many colors do you see in the image if you ignore variations in
% brightness?  There are three colors: white, blue, and pink.  Notice how easily
% you can visually distinguish these colors from one another.  The L*a*b* color
% space (also known as CIELAB or CIE L*a*b*) enables you to quantify these
% visual differences.
%
% The L*a*b* color space is derived from the CIE XYZ tristimulus values.  The
% L*a*b* space consists of a luminosity layer 'L*', chromaticity-layer 'a*'
% indicating where color falls along the red-green axis, and chromaticity-layer
% 'b*' indicating where the color falls along the blue-yellow axis. All of the
% color information is in the 'a*' and 'b*' layers. You can measure the
% difference between two colors using the Euclidean distance metric.
%
% Convert the image to L*a*b* color space using |makecform| and |applycform|.

% cform = makecform('srgb2lab');
% lab_he = applycform(I,cform);
lab_he = rgb2hsv(I);

%% Step 3: Classify the Colors in 'a*b*' Space Using K-Means Clustering
% Clustering is a way to separate groups of objects.  K-means clustering treats
% each object as having a location in space. It finds partitions such that
% objects within each cluster are as close to each other as possible, and as far
% from objects in other clusters as possible. K-means clustering requires that
% you specify the number of clusters to be partitioned and a distance metric to
% quantify how close two objects are to each other.
%
% Since the color information exists in the 'a*b*' space, your objects are
% pixels with 'a*' and 'b*' values.  Use |kmeans| to cluster the objects into
% three clusters using the Euclidean distance metric.

% ab = double(lab_he(:,:,2:3));
ab = double(lab_he(:,:,1:2));

nrows = size(ab,1);
ncols = size(ab,2);
ab = reshape(ab,nrows*ncols,2);

nColors = 3;
% repeat the clustering 3 times to avoid local minima
[cluster_idx, cluster_center] = kmeans(ab,nColors,'distance','sqEuclidean', ...
                                      'Replicates',8); % 3

%% Step 4: Label Every Pixel in the Image Using the Results from KMEANS
% For every object in your input, |kmeans| returns an index corresponding to a
% cluster. The |cluster_center| output from |kmeans| will be used later in the
% example. Label every pixel in the image with its |cluster_index|.

pixel_labels = reshape(cluster_idx,nrows,ncols);
% imshow(pixel_labels,[]), title('image labeled by cluster index');

return;

%% Step 5: Create Images that Segment the H&E Image by Color.
% Using |pixel_labels|, you can separate objects in |hestain.png| by color,
% which will result in three images.

segmented_images = cell(1,3);
rgb_label = repmat(pixel_labels,[1 1 3]);

for k = 1:nColors
    color = I;
    color(rgb_label ~= k) = 0;
    segmented_images{k} = color;
end

imshow(segmented_images{1}), title('objects in cluster 1');

%% 

imshow(segmented_images{2}), title('objects in cluster 2');

%% 

imshow(segmented_images{3}), title('objects in cluster 3');

%% Step 6: Segment the Nuclei into a Separate Image
% Notice that there are dark and light blue objects in one of the clusters.
% You can separate dark blue from light blue using the 'L*' layer in the
% L*a*b* color space. The cell nuclei are dark blue.
%
% Recall that the 'L*' layer contains the brightness values of each color.
% Find the cluster that contains the blue objects. Extract the brightness
% values of the pixels in this cluster and threshold them with a global
% threshold using |imbinarize|.
%
% You must programmatically determine the index of the cluster containing
% the blue objects because |kmeans| will not return the same |cluster_idx|
% value every time.  You can do this using the |cluster_center| value,
% which contains the mean 'a*' and 'b*' value for each cluster. The blue
% cluster has the smallest cluster_center value (determined
% experimentally).
mean_cluster_value = mean(cluster_center,2);
[tmp, idx] = sort(mean_cluster_value);
blue_cluster_num = idx(1);

L = lab_he(:,:,1);
blue_idx = find(pixel_labels == blue_cluster_num);
L_blue = L(blue_idx);
is_light_blue = imbinarize(L_blue);

%%
% Use the mask |is_light_blue| to label which pixels belong to the blue
% nuclei. Then display the blue nuclei in a separate image.

nuclei_labels = repmat(uint8(0),[nrows ncols]);
nuclei_labels(blue_idx(is_light_blue==false)) = 1;
nuclei_labels = repmat(nuclei_labels,[1 1 3]);
blue_nuclei = I;
blue_nuclei(nuclei_labels ~= 1) = 0;
imshow(blue_nuclei), title('blue nuclei');
